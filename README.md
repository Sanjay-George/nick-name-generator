# nick-name-generator - A Cloud 🌦️ Native App
Some key 🔑 features of this app:
* Microservice architecture
* Simple API Gateway with partial fault tolerance 
* Containerized using docker
* K8s deployment with HPA
* *Grafana and Prometheus (TBD, might be in a separate repo with IaC for deploying on AWS / Openstack)*

### Why use this app? 
Absolutely no reason! 🤷‍♂️

**Although, I appreciate suggestions to improve the architecture or code. Please create an issue or a PR for the same**

### Next steps 🪜
1. Create a simple front end 
2. Deploy on public cloud.
